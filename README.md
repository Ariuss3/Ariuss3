- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ariuss3. I am bored and need a mental break from coding. I found that I can make a readme on GitHub about myself, so here I am. Doing that. Right now. Yep.

- 👀 I’m interested in: Yes. I am a bit of a Polymath, so everything... 
-    But I love video games, and making them, so right now I am interested in making games, mods, and other related things.
-    Mostly just learning/practicing my programing skills. (And abysmal typing accuracy (Curse you dyslexia))

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Code. Making video games in HTML5, RPG Maker or UE4/5 are the most likely things I am up to.
-    Probably working on something in JS, although I have used UE4 a bunch, so I might be doing C++.
-    Machine Learning, and Python also are things I would like to learn at some point, and might be doing that at the moment.
-    I also am getting my A+ Cerification so there is that too.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Stuff. Probably video games.

- 📫 How to reach me: Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me...
-    Or ignore the Kim Possible joke, and just message me or something.


- Also the worst thing ever is the insert key. Change my mind.
